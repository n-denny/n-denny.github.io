## Onyx Aircraft Design
I participated in the AIAA Undergraduate Design Competition from August 2021 through May 2022 with my team, Onyx. The focus of this competition was to design an aerial firefighting response aircraft more effective than the ones being used today. We successfully submitted an 87 page report detailing the schematics and performance of our aircraft.

**My main contributions to the project included:**

2D Airfoil Analysis
Flight Parameter Analysis in Python
AutoCAD Schematics
Aerodynamic Simulations
Auxiliary System Planning
Mission Performance Analysis
Stability Considerations
Design Input
