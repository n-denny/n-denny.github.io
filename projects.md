## <ins>Onyx Aircraft Design</ins>
I participated in the AIAA Undergraduate Design Competition from August 2021 through May 2022 with my team, Onyx. The focus of this competition was to design an aerial firefighting response aircraft more effective than the ones being used today. We successfully submitted an 87 page report detailing the schematics and performance of our aircraft.

**My main contributions to the project included:**
- 2D Airfoil Analysis
- Flight Parameter Analysis in Python
- AutoCAD Schematics
- Aerodynamic Simulations
- Auxiliary System Planning
- Mission Performance Analysis
- Stability Considerations
- Design Input

## <ins>Interplanetary Mission Design</ins>
I recently finished working on a project involving the design of three interplanetary missions from Earth to Mars. The three missions consist of:

1. Two-impulse mission directly from Earth to Mars
2. Three-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, then from Venus to Mars
3. Two-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, flyby of Venus, capture Mars

This project required:

- Use of Matlab to make plots of orbital trajectories in 2D and 3D (as seen to the right)
- Solving astrodynamics equations for orbital elements
- Solving Lambert's Problem numerically
- Using an ephemeris to gather data on planets' positions and velocities
