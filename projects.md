## <ins>Onyx Aircraft Design</ins>
I participated in the AIAA Undergraduate Design Competition from August 2021 through May 2022 with my team, Onyx. The focus of this competition was to design an aerial firefighting response aircraft more effective than the ones being used today. We successfully submitted an 87 page report detailing the schematics and performance of our aircraft.

**My main contributions to the project included:**
- 2D Airfoil Analysis
- Flight Parameter Analysis in Python
- AutoCAD Schematics
- Aerodynamic Simulations
- Auxiliary System Planning
- Mission Performance Analysis
- Stability Considerations
- Design Input

## <ins>Interplanetary Mission Design</ins>
I recently finished working on a project involving the design of three interplanetary missions from Earth to Mars. The three missions consist of:

1. Two-impulse mission directly from Earth to Mars
2. Three-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, then from Venus to Mars
3. Two-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, flyby of Venus, capture Mars

This project required:

- Use of Matlab to make plots of orbital trajectories in 2D and 3D
- Solving astrodynamics equations for orbital elements
- Solving Lambert's Problem numerically
- Using an ephemeris to gather data on planets' positions and velocities

## <ins>Cropduster Design</ins>
In the fall of 2021 I participated in a group project requiring the design of a cropdusting aircraft. My group put together a comprehensive design of an aircraft that on paper could dust remote fields in a more efficient time than similar cropdusters in use today, thus becoming financially desirable.

This project consisted of heavy use of Matlab, as we developed a program that could analyze the flight performance of our aircraft.

My main contributions to the project included:
- Design Input
- Matlab Programming and Debugging
- Knowledge of Aircraft Performance Equations
- OpenVSP Solid Modeling
- XFLR5 Data Analysis

  ## <ins>"Lighter Than Air" Drone</ins>
In Fall 2020, my team designed a balloon-assisted drone that with the objective of completing an obstacle course. This project involved controls knowledge, electronic wiring, 3D Modeling, and planning.

My contributions to the project included:
- Design Input
- Autodesk Inventor 3D Modeling
- Control Design
- AutoCAD Electronic and Wood Usage Schematics
