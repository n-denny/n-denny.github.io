## <ins>Senior Design</ins>
My team of 8 aerospace engineering students designed and manufactured a lightweight aircraft to specific requirements. It was designed to maximize endurance through the use of in-flight solar panel charging. One semester was spent on design and the second semester was used for manufacturing and flight testing. The plane was able to take off of a 10 foot ramp at an include of 5 degrees as well as successfully utilize an autopilot component. The completed plane was comprised of:
- Lite-ply internal cage 
- Blue foam outer fuselage
- Lite-ply rib and carbon fiber spar mid-wing
- Blue foam outboard wings with carbon fiber spars
- Blue foam V-Tail with carbon fiber spars
- Carbon fiber boom
- Carbon fiber layup winglets filled with composite insulation


My contributions have been:

- Modeled the plane, internal manufacturing methods, and design iterations in SOLIDWORKS
- Heavy design input and manufacturing help

## <ins>Aero-structural Optimization of a Rocket Fin</ins>
My team of 3 aerospace engineering students are creating an aero-structural optimization of a rocket fin. We used Python and the OpenMDAO framework to achieve this goal. SU2 was used to run a multiphysics simulation and also to deform the aerodynamic and structural meshes. Free-form deformation (FFD) points were used to change the shape of the fin and subsequent simulations were run to compute the objectives and constraints of the optimization. The objective of the optimization was to minimize drag, and the sole constraint was on the von Mises stress in order to ensure safety. The optimization used a Python function that called SU2 to deform the meshes according to an input of FFD displacements. The function would then run the multiphysics simulation on the updated meshes and return the objective and constraint. It would then manage the files on your system to aid in simple post-processing.

My contributions to this project included:
- Python programming
- SU2 integration into OpenMDAO

## <ins>Onyx Aircraft Design</ins>
I participated in the AIAA Undergraduate Design Competition from August 2021 through May 2022 with my team, Onyx. The focus of this competition was to design an aerial firefighting response aircraft more effective than the ones being used today. We successfully submitted an 87 page report detailing the schematics and performance of our aircraft.

**My main contributions to the project included:**
- 2D Airfoil Analysis
- Flight Parameter Analysis in Python
- AutoCAD Schematics
- Aerodynamic Simulations
- Auxiliary System Planning
- Mission Performance Analysis
- Stability Considerations
- Design Input

## <ins>Interplanetary Mission Design</ins>
I recently finished working on a project involving the design of three interplanetary missions from Earth to Mars. The three missions consist of:

1. Two-impulse mission directly from Earth to Mars
2. Three-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, then from Venus to Mars
3. Two-impulse mission from Earth to Venus, flyby of Venus, capture Mars

This project required:

- Use of Matlab to make plots of orbital trajectories in 2D and 3D
- Solving astrodynamics equations for orbital elements
- Solving Lambert's Problem numerically
- Using an ephemeris to gather data on planets' positions and velocities

## <ins>Cropduster Design</ins>
In the fall of 2021 I participated in a group project requiring the design of a cropdusting aircraft. My group put together a comprehensive design of an aircraft that on paper could dust remote fields in a more efficient time than similar cropdusters in use today, thus becoming financially desirable.

This project consisted of heavy use of Matlab, as we developed a program that could analyze the flight performance of our aircraft.

My main contributions to the project included:
- Design Input
- Matlab Programming and Debugging
- Knowledge of Aircraft Performance Equations
- OpenVSP Solid Modeling
- XFLR5 Data Analysis

## <ins>"Lighter Than Air" Drone</ins>
In Fall 2020, my team designed a balloon-assisted drone that with the objective of completing an obstacle course. This project involved controls knowledge, electronic wiring, 3D Modeling, and planning.

My contributions to the project included:
- Design Input
- Autodesk Inventor 3D Modeling
- Control Design
- AutoCAD Electronic and Wood Usage Schematics
