## Senior Design
My team of 8 aerospace engineering students are designing and manufacturing a lightweight aircraft to specific requirements. It must be designed to maximize endurance through the use of in-flight solar panel charging. Manufacturing is underway and wind tunnel tests have been conducted.

My contributions have been:
- Modeled the plane, internal manufacturing methods, and design iterations in SOLIDWORKS
- Heavy design input and manufacturing help

## Aero-Thermal-Structural Multi-disciplinary Design Optimization
My team of 3 aerospace engineering students are creating an aero-thermal-structural optimization of a rocket fin. We are using Python and the OpenMDAO framework to achieve this goal.
